Title: "Sales Data Analysis and Customer Segmentation Using Clustering Techniques."

Project Description:
This project focuses on analyzing sales data to uncover patterns, trends, and customer segments using clustering techniques. 
The dataset, sourced from "New 1000 Sales Record.xlsx," includes transaction details such as order dates, shipping times, and other sales-related features. 
The goal is to preprocess the data, apply clustering algorithms (such as K-Means), and visualize the results to derive actionable business insights. 
The project leverages Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Key Objectives:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, standardize data, and engineer new features (e.g., calculating order-to-ship days).

Convert date columns into a usable format for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize sales trends, regional performance, and product categories.

Identify correlations and outliers in the dataset.

Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering:

Apply feature scaling (StandardScaler) to normalize data.

Determine optimal cluster numbers using metrics like the silhouette score.

Segment customers based on purchasing behavior (e.g., frequency, order value, shipping time).

Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):

Reduce feature dimensions for better visualization and clustering efficiency.

Interpret principal components to understand key influencing factors.

Visualization and Insights:

Plot clusters to identify distinct customer groups.

Provide business recommendations based on segmentation results.
